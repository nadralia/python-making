# python-making

Hi student basing on your code here are my review
1. learn how to define a variable in python. (boolean, string and number)
   i see you are trying to define variables on line 2 of file main.py
2. On line 3, i see you have created an init function that takes 4 agruments
   I think you are trying to create the constructor of the class but you haven't defined the class. Please the constructor inside the class definition.
   search how to create a class in python
3. One thing you should know is python uses indentation to highlight the blocks of code. Whitespace is used for indentation in Python. All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right
----so check line 4, and make sure you ident it. 

4. And please be careful when create a loop. make sure you don't create a never ending loop. i can lead to crashes. So in that case ..also research on loops ..especially while loop ..

5. finally check my sample code for you .. reviewCode.py ..start from there.

6. Make you understand the basics and fundamentals of python. it's very important to that then we can sync on zoom for a peer programming call .
